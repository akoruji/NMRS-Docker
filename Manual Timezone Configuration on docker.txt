Manual Timezone Configuration

The timestamps in the log seem to show two different time zones or formats:
2025-01-06 15:24:16 - The time logged by the application.
2025-01-06 14:24:16,675 - The time from the container which is 1 hour behind.

To align these times, you can adjust the timezone or ensure consistent time settings across your environment.
If your container is Alpine-based (the OS we used to develop the docker images), follow these steps:

1. Access the running container:
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/sh
2. Update apk and install tzdata (timezone data package):
apk update
apk add tzdata
3. Set the timezone:
Copy the Africa/Lagos timezone file to /etc/localtime:
cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Africa/Lagos /etc/localtime
4. Verify the Change: Run the date command to confirm the timezone is updated:
date
